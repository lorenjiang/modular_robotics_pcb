Notes on PCB design for micromiror drive

July 8, 2018
need to add modular_pcb.lbr to Eagle directories.
Tried File-open-> libary, but can't edit symbol or contents

Eagle: header for connector, 3M has walled header
pinhead directory has double row headers
pinhd-2x4

move objects:
1) select group
2) select move
3) ctrl-right to move
4) left to place

libraries: control panel: options: directories :browse

Errata and changes from July 2018 PCB
1) BOM: X5 should be vertical, not horizontal to avoid mounting hole H5.
2) DRC: supply pin overwritten 3v3. Was previously output from Arduino board, but now is local.
3) DRC: 15V on D1, D3, D4, D5 too close to collector and arcs. (Was only 30 mils)
